B. we set up jenkins and maven as well

C. we integrated Github with jenkins:

- Installed Git on Jenkins Instance
- Installed Github Plugin on jenkins GUI
- Configured Git on Jenkins GUI

D. we integrated maven with Jenkins , so that we can pull the code unto jenkins and build with the help of maven
